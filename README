Hello! 

Before you jump in with your daks off, you need to install SMARTY on your server. This is a SMARTY site/application! 

Then in the root of your smarty folders (the same folder where you would find /libs/ you need to create: db.quonkay.php

db.quonkay.php should look like the below: 

<?php
	define('DB_HOST', '');
	define('DB_USER', '');
	define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
	define('DB_DATABASE', '');
?>

Fill the empty's in with your correct variables!
